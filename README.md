## üìñ Project Overview

This project tackles the challenge of identifying fraudulent online transactions using machine learning techniques. Fraudulent transactions lead to significant financial losses, and by leveraging data science, we can enhance security and build trust in e-commerce.

The core of this project involves:
- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing:** Handling a large dataset with numerous features and significant missing values.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating meaningful features from transactional and identity data.
- **Model Building:** Implementing and evaluating several classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Evaluation:** Using metrics like the Area Under the Curve (AUC) to measure model performance, with a final competition score of **0.8766**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn:** For data preprocessing and building Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.
- **XGBoost:** For building the primary gradient-boosted model.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For analysis and reporting.
